# Documents

Here are all my documents not found in my wiki!

They are here either because they aren't appropriate for the wiki aka not public knowledge or because I couldnt figure out how to put a table on the wiki...

* meetingNotes
  * this folder contains any notes from meetings had with the client
  
* dataDictionary.docx
  * A table listing the variables and their correct formats / descriptions from the mainLoop function

* designBrief.pptx
  * A design brief including all of the important information for our client, entitling what we are doing our work agreement and also the license agreement for this project
