What client wants: "Running a resturant, internet cafe opened, losing customers, better wifi and computers,
 better food, want the customers back"
"I want a tablet game they can play while they wait. Want a leaderboard so its competitive. Something like space invaders.

How competitve would you like the game: Not so competitive that people wont start, two or three levels. PROGRESSION
game to get harder as they get better, progressive difficulty.

Small element of chance, prefer a game of skill.

Light hearted atmosphere, not like WoW.

Really easy to start playing.

No swearing, no nudity and no simulated sex. No blood or animated violence.

Open to any sort of port
