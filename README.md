# Flippin Fly's

Flippin Fly's is a game where the player controls a fly which is actually just a black box. It has a monochromatic colour scheme to attempt to fit into as many cafe's as possible. This way it is stylish, trendy and modern. The asthetic can easily be modified if needed. Currently it is in working condition, there are some features not yet implemented into the game, for example the ability to change the difficulty by playing on different planets thus having a different gravity. When the player dies you can replay just by hittin the raplay button on the bottom screen. Making the game entirely self contained and once it has been started does not need to be retarted. So just hit run and enjoy!
